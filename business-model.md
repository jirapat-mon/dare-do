# DareDo Business Model — "Discipline as a Service"

## 1. Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue: Platform Fee (5%)
- User deposits ฿100 → Platform holds ฿100 in Central Wallet
- Success: Return ฿95 to user (5% fee = ฿5 revenue)
- Failure: Keep 100% (฿100 revenue)

### Secondary Revenue: Failed Challenges
- Industry average: ~60% of people fail self-imposed challenges
- This is the main profit driver
- Example: 100 users × ฿500 avg deposit × 60% fail rate = ฿30,000 revenue

### Tertiary Revenue (Future):
- Premium features (custom badges, analytics)
- Corporate wellness programs (B2B)
- Sponsored challenges (brand partnerships)

## 2. Points & Streak System

### Points Earning:
| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Complete 1 day | 10 pts |
| 7-day streak | 15 pts/day (1.5x) |
| 14-day streak | 20 pts/day (2x) |
| 30-day streak | 30 pts/day (3x) |
| Complete a full challenge | 200 bonus pts |
| Refer a friend | 300 pts |
| First challenge ever | 100 bonus pts |

### Streak Tiers:
| Tier | Requirement | Benefits |
|------|------------|----------|
| Bronze | 0 pts | Base rate (5% fee) |
| Silver | 1,000 pts | 4% fee, priority support |
| Gold | 2,500 pts | 3% fee, exclusive challenges |
| Legend | 5,000 pts | 2% fee, free challenge monthly |

### Point Redemption:
| Points | Reward | Platform Cost |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| 500 | ฿25 wallet credit | ฿25 |
| 1,000 | 3% fee (1 time) | ~฿10 savings for user |
| 2,500 | 100% refund voucher | 5% of next deposit |
| 5,000 | Free ฿200 challenge | ฿200 |

### Points Expiry: 6 months from earn date

## 3. Wallet System

### Central Wallet:
- All deposits go to platform's central wallet
- Successful refunds are processed from central wallet
- Users see their "DareDo Wallet" balance (personal)
- Can top up and withdraw

### Transaction Types:
- Deposit (challenge start)
- Refund (challenge success)
- Points credit (redeemed)
- Forfeited (challenge failed)
- Top up (add funds)
- Withdrawal (cash out)

## 4. Why Users Stay (Retention Mechanics)

1. **Loss Aversion**: Fear of losing money → Complete challenges
2. **Streak Pressure**: Don't want to break a streak → Keep going
3. **Points Accumulation**: Getting close to next reward → Start new challenge
4. **Tier Status**: Silver/Gold/Legend feels exclusive → Maintain status
5. **Social Proof**: See 87% success rate → "I can do it too"
6. **Sunk Cost**: Already invested time/money → Don't quit now

## 5. Profitability Analysis

### Conservative Scenario (1,000 users/month):
- Avg deposit: ฿500
- Success rate: 40%
- Revenue from fees: 400 users × ฿500 × 5% = ฿10,000
- Revenue from failures: 600 users × ฿500 = ฿300,000
- Points liability: ~฿15,000/month
- **Net revenue: ~฿295,000/month**

### Break-even: ~50 active users

## 6. Legal Compliance

### NOT Gambling Because:
1. No element of chance — outcome 100% user-controlled
2. No betting between parties — user bets against themselves
3. Money returns to same user — no transfer to winners
4. Fee is service charge — not house edge
5. Points are loyalty rewards — like airline miles

### Legal Framework:
- Self-Commitment Contract (สัญญาผูกมัดตนเอง)
- Loyalty Program (โปรแกรมสะสมแต้ม)
- Not covered by พ.ร.บ.การพนัน พ.ศ. 2478
- Similar to: gym commitment contracts, savings apps with penalties

### Required Licenses:
- e-Money license (if holding funds) — or use payment partner
- Standard business registration
- Privacy policy (PDPA compliance)

## 7. Future Expansion

### Phase 2: Social Features
- Challenge with friends (group accountability)
- Leaderboards (anonymized)
- Challenge templates marketplace

### Phase 3: B2B Corporate Wellness
- Companies buy challenge packages for employees
- Corporate dashboard for HR
- Custom branding

### Phase 4: API & Partnerships
- Integration with fitness apps (auto-verify)
- Bank partnerships (auto-deposit from savings)
- Insurance partnerships (health incentives)
